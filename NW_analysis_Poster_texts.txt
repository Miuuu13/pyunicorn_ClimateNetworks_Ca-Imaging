Network theory – Introduction
Network theory offers the possibility to structure complex systems into a form, that makes it interpretable by so-called network metrics. These network metrics are the key concept (?) of network theory and they allow to quantify 
Network theory underlies the construction of networks to understand complex systems. It is widely used to model and analyze the interplay of various components within a system. 
The main tool to model networks is a graph, built from nodes and edges. Nodes represent the basic elements of a network and serve as connection points. The edges in turn represent the connections between the individual nodes.

Siehe plots in gitlab folder networkAnalysis und HeatmapPlot. Here our story:

networkAnalysis:
Density is relatively constant for both R+ and R-, with a slightly higher density for R+. That means R+ networks have more connections than R-, relative to the number of nodes. Overall, we need to be careful as our R- have much mode nodes, hence all analysis is preliminary until we are sure we see an effect of the resilience, and not only of network size.

//check literature!!!
Transitivity ("number of triangles", i.e. fraction of all possible triangles) decreases over time more R+ than for R-, same for avg_clustering. that means that the average number of triangles of a given node is also reduced, both are related.

Luminance Heatmap:
Plotted in subfolder fig is the mean luminance, zscore normalized, over all animals (R+ and R- separately) and over all neurons, and over all CS+ tone presentations. First vertical line is tone starts, second vertical line is shock started in the shock session, and third line is end of tone, time is in seconds aligned to tone starts.  It seems that the R- react much stronger to the time at which a shock might be expected. This is true for day 1 and 2 (first and second line of the yaxis), then the effect disappears, there seems to be some extinction.

Preliminary Conclusion: Along the subsequent days of extinction, the network of R+ animals loose complexity, while the R- animals stay at the same level of complexity.
